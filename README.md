- **NLP Analysis Report**: A detailed analysis of the article using NLP techniques.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization.
- **Feature Extraction Methods**:
  - **Bag of Words (BoW)**
  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
  - **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)**
- **Findings and Analysis**: Evaluation of different feature extraction methods.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of the strengths and limitations of each method.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Scikit-learn
- Gensim (for Word2Vec)
- Pandas & NumPy

## **How to Use**
1. Download the repository containing the **NLP Analysis Report**.
